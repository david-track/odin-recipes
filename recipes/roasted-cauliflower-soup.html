    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I created this delicious and creamy cauliflower soup to bring to work for
      a healthy lunch. I hope you enjoy it too!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 head cauliflower, cut into small florets</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons roasted garlic-flavored extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dry sherry</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place cauliflower in a small roasting pan. Drizzle with oil and season
        with nutmeg, garlic powder, salt, and pepper; toss to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast cauliflower in the preheated oven stirring every 10 minutes until
        golden brown and tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add chopped onion;
        cook and stir until lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle flour over onions and stir to coat. Slowly pour chicken broth
        and milk into the pan. Mix with a wire whisk until flour is dissolved.
        Bring to a boil, stirring continuously, until it thickens. Reduce heat
        to low and stir in sherry and roasted cauliflower. Serve as-is, or blend
        half and recombine with the rest of the soup for a thicker consistency.

    </ol>
